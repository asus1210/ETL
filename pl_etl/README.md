# My ETL Project

This project demonstrates a basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline in Python.

## Project Structure

- `etl_pipeline`: Contains the core ETL pipeline code split into three files: `extract.py`, `transform.py`, and `load.py`.
- `config`: Stores configuration files such as `config.yaml` and `logging.yaml`.
- `data`: Contains the data used in the ETL process, divided into `raw`, `intermediate`, and `processed` subdirectories.
- `tests`: Includes unit tests for each ETL step.
- `main.py`: The entry point of the ETL application.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the ETL project.
- `README.md`: Documentation explaining the purpose, setup, and usage of the project.

## How to Run

1. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Execute the ETL pipeline: `python main.py`.
